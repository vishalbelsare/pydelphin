"""
This module contains classes and methods related to Minimal Recursion
Semantics [MRS]_. In addition to MRS, there are the related formalisms
Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics [RMRS]_, Elementary Dependency
Structures [EDS]_, and Dependency Minimal Recursion Semantics [DMRS]_.
As a convenience, \*MRS refers to the collection of MRS and related
formalisms (so "MRS" then refers to the original formalism), and
PyDelphin accordingly defines :class:`~delphin.mrs.xmrs.Xmrs` as the
common subclass for the various formalisms.

Users will interact mostly with :class:`~delphin.mrs.xmrs.Xmrs`
objects, but will not often instantiate them directly. Instead, they
are created by serializing one of the various formats (such as
:mod:`delphin.mrs.simplemrs`, :mod:`delphin.mrs.mrx`, or
:mod;`delphin.mrs.dmrx`). No matter what serialization format (or
formalism) is used to load a \*MRS structure, it will be stored the
same way in memory, so any queries or actions taken on these structures
will use the same methods.

def convert(txt, src_fmt, tgt_fmt, single=True, **kwargs):
    """
    Convert a textual representation of \*MRS from one the src_fmt
    representation to the tgt_fmt representation. By default, only
    read and convert a single \*MRS object (e.g. for `mrx` this
    starts at <mrs> and not <mrs-list>), but changing the `mode`
    argument to `corpus` (alternatively: `list`) reads and converts
    multiple \*MRSs.

    Args:
        txt: A string of semantic data.
        src_fmt: The original representation format of txt.
        tgt_fmt: The representation format to convert to.
        single: If True, assume txt represents a single \*MRS, otherwise
            read it as a corpus (or list) of \*MRSs.
        kwargs: Any other keyword arguments to pass to the serializer
            of the target format. See Notes.
    Returns:
        A string in the target format.
    Notes:
        src_fmt and tgt_fmt may be one of the following:

        | format    | description                  |
        | --------- | ---------------------------- |
        | simplemrs | The popular SimpleMRS format |
        | mrx       | The XML format of MRS        |
        | dmrx      | The XML format of DMRS       |

        Additional keyword arguments for the serializer may include:

        | option       | description                         |
        | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
        | pretty_print | print with newlines and indentation |
        | color        | print with syntax highlighting      |
